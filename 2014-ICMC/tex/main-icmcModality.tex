\section{Overview of Modality Concept and Aims}
\label{sec:overview_of_modality_concept_and_aims}

Modality is a project dedicated to modal interaction with synthesis processes for physical control in performance. Its primary product is the Modality Toolkit, a library to facilitate straightforward access to hardware controllers in the SuperCollider programming language. It is designed and developed by the ModalityTeam, a group of people that see themselves as both users and developers both of and for SuperCollider.

The central idea behind the Modality Toolkit is to simplify the creation of individual electronic instruments using controllers of various kinds. To this end, a common code interface, MKtl, is used for connecting controllers from various sources and protocols. Currently HID and MIDI are supported with OSC, serial port and GUI-based interfaces are planned to be integrated.

The name Modality arose from the idea to scaffold the creation of modal interfaces, i.e., to create interfaces where e.g. one physical controller can be used for different purposes or it is possible to switch its functionality, even at runtime. It is our belief that integration of such on-the-fly remapping features helps to create instruments that are flexible, powerful, and interesting to play. The strength of such a modal interface is that it allows for fast changes and more opportunity for sonic discovery as can be necessary when, for example, improvising with musicians playing acoustic instruments. 



\section{Scope of Modality}
\label{sec:scope_of_modality_tech_info_where_what}


\subsection{Unifications of interface implementations}
\label{sub:unifications_of_interface_implementations}

With MKtl, it is possible to assign functionality to controller elements.
Each MKtl object has elements such as sliders or knobs. It is possible to assign an action to such an element that is evauated every time, the value of that element gets updated. Below, there are two examples using popular MIDI controller.

\begin{Verbatim}
k = MKtl('nnkn20');
\end{Verbatim}



\begin{itemize}
	\item Modality toolkit + Various Mixed Things + closely related
	\item more related libs - FP/FRP, wslib, JITLibExtensions, 
		all of Marijes device related quarks, etc 
\end{itemize}

\section{Islands and Bridges, uniform protocols}
\label{sec:islands_and_bridges_uniform_protocols}

Uniform devices (MIDI, HID, OSC, GUI, Serial)
		with rich descriptions, hierarchical names for all elements
		FakeGUI for everything


	
	Uniform destinations:
		set messages, RelSet, SoftSet, // if Influx, influence

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

Transformer islands: 
		FRP, Influx, others 
		- process incoming events, pass on results to destinations.

\section{Examples / Use Cases}
\label{sec:examples_use_cases}




\subsection{MPD 18}
\label{sub:mpd_18}

The MPD18 has 16 Buttons and a slider.

    [Sound Buttons] Buttons 1-3 are mapped to adsr enveloped sound sources.
        By pushing them down sound turns on; releasing: sound off.
    the Slider sets amplitude (or pitch) for the (sound)source of the currently depressed button.
    [Memory Slots] Buttons 5-16 represent 'memory' positions (initially not mapped)
        if sound is assigned (see below), sound is played when button depressed.
    [Shift Button] Button 4 is a 'shift key'. When depressed
        Sound Buttons don't trigger any sound but select the active slot. This can be followed by
        depressing a Memory Slot button, which assigns the selected sound to that pad.
        if you release the shift key before assignment, nothing happens.
        assigning a copy to an already assigned memory slot replaces existing
        mute copy +[Sound Button then Shift button]
        Sound Button triggers sound
        depress Memory Slot button, assigning the sound to the pad, with sound
