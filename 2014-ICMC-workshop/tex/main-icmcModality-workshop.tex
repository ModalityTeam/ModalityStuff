\section{Overview of the modality concept and its aims}
\label{sec:overview_of_modality_concept_and_aims}


The Modality project is dedicated to modal interaction with synthesis processes for physical control in performance and musical practice.
The name \emph{Modality} arose from the idea to investigate the creation and extensive use of modal interfaces.
One particular strength of such modal interfaces is that they allow fast changes and therefore a braoder variety for sonic discovery.
This can be of benefit when, for example, improvising with musicians playing acoustic instruments.
Out of this arouse the question on how HCI interfaces can be both conceptualised and actually built, in which a small set of physical controls are used for a relatively a amount of purposes.
We contend that integration of such on-the-fly remapping features helps to create flexible instruments that are powerful yet interesting and therefore rewarding to play and listen to. 

The primary product of the Modality project is the \emph{Modality Toolkit}, a software library that facilitates (a) access to hardware and software controllers, (b) flexible routing of control messages to generative processes, and (c) recording, filtering and further processing of controller signals.
The ModalityTeam, an international and transdisciplinary group of people that see themselves as users and developers for SuperCollider meets at regular intervals to work on the library, discuss issues around music performance and composition, and perform in self-organised concerts.

The idea behind the Modality Toolkit is to simplify the creation of individual electronic instruments using controllers of various kinds. 
To this end, a common code interface, MKtl, is used for connecting controllers from various sources and protocols. 
Currently HID and MIDI are supported with OSC, GUI-based interfaces can be created on the fly from interface descriptions.

\section{Workshop content}
\label{sec:workshop_content}

The concept of the workshop is to be as “hands-­on” as possible.
Participants will learn how to use the Modality toolkit, create their own instruments, and play together with their creations. 
Under the guidance of the Modality Work Group, each participant will be able to work on his or her own instrument, and use and play it along with the other participants.

In detail, the outline of the workshop is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item brief introduction to the Modality toolkit,
	\item installation party,
	\item mapping out devices (i.e., writing description files for them), in case the devices brought are not yet specified in Modality (contributing to the library of known devices),
	\item accessing devices and using data from devices,
	\item creating a basic sound--controller setup,
	\item working on complex event logic with the goal of creating interesting relationships between controller data and audio processes,
	\item swap controllers and share sounds between participants,
	\item performing with the system
\end{itemize}



Participants should bring 
\begin{itemize}
	\item MIDI or HID controllers such as game gads, joysticks or fader boxes, 
	\item their own laptops with a recent version of SuperCollider installed, and
	\item a basic familiarity with the SuperCollider programming environment.
\end{itemize}
