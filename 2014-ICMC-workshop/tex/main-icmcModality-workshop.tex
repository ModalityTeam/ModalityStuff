\begin{abstract}
The Modality Toolkit aims to improve and facilitate the use of digital technology within interactive sound art and music. 
Written in SuperCollider, it simplifies the creation of individual electronic instruments by combining custom sound engines with off-the-shelf controllers. 
To this end, a common code interface, |MKtl|, is used to connect controllers from various sources and protocols. 
Currently, HID and MIDI are supported; GUI-based interfaces can be created on the fly from interface descriptions.

In the workshop, the toolkit is introduced and used by participants to lay out their control ideas and play music with each other.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The proposed workshop accompanies the paper ``Advances in Modality''.

\todo{some more words on modality.}

The workshop is intended to be as “hands-­on” as possible.
Under the guidance of members of the ModalityTeam, each participant will learn how to use the Modality toolkit to work on her own instrument, and use and play it along with other participants.

In detail, the proposed workshop has the following structure:

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0em
	\item a brief introduction to the Modality toolkit,
	\item an installation party, in which the toolkit is installed (takes 5-10 minutes),
	\item mapping out devices (i.e., writing description files for them), in case the brought devices are not yet specified in Modality (contributing to the library of known devices),
	\item accessing devices and using data from devices; creating a basic sound--controller setup,
	\item performing with the system,
	\item swap controllers and share sounds between participants,
	\item adaption of the setup and manipulation of data streams,
	\item performing with the system
\end{enumerate}


\section{Intended audience and hardware to bring}
\label{sec:participants}

Workshop participants should have basic knowledge in programming sounds in SuperCollider, e.g. with |SynthDef| or |Ndef|. 
This can be, however, low-profile; having worked through one of the SuperCollider tutorials on how to make sounds should be enough.

Additionally, each participant is required to bring
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
	\item at least one MIDI or HID controller such as a game gad, a joystick or a fader box, 
	\item a laptop with a recent version of SuperCollider installed, 
	\item a mini jack to mono jacks cable to connect the laptop to a mixing desk, and
	\item a pair of headphones.
\end{itemize}

The hosting institution should provide a stereo pair of speakers including amplification and a mixing desk.
